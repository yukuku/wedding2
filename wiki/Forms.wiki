#summary Interface forms


According to our discussion,

We haven’t done any of the following forms

1. Auto Assign Form

to create separate class for application logic. 
*We haven’t decided the form interface.*

2. Guest Edit/Delete Form

There will be two forms for this, one will show the guest information in grid, there will be one button for delete and one link for edit(support guest id in grid will be link). If the guest id is clicked, one form will be appeared to edit this guest information. After updating, the system will redirect to first grid form.

Example: _ Waku  _   [ Delete ]

3. Manual Assign Form

There will be grid showing guest information and then click assign. New form with available tables will be shown, select table and click ok.

4. Attendance Form

A grid showing the guest information will have dropdown list for every row. From this dropdown list, u can select whatever status u want to change and then click save.

5.	Wedding Form

Need to add function for editing wedding information

6.	Report --> _Changed Name to 'Guest List'_

This form will have one dropdown list to choose wedding and grid to show all guest information about the selected wedding.
By clicking the guest id, the user can go to edit guest information.

Need to-do
 * Deleting guest function
 * Export servlets
 * Editing / Updating Guest: ^Depends on^ Item 2


7.	Add Guest Form

Need to implement for file uploading function. After file uploading, the system will redirect to Report (without showing wedding dropdown)
